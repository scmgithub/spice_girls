Ooh, yeah, yeah come on
You think you're quick but, I'd like to see you keep up with me
You think you're slick but, I'd like to see you pull a trick on me
You think you're so cool, Hey big man! you're old school
You think you're smart, but who the hell d'ya think you're talking to
Everyone can see who you are,
Take a look at yourself, tell me why keep on denying
Everything you say (denying) everything you do,
So be a fool to yourself forever more, trying
Any kind of move, tell me, So what's it gonna prove
You ain't fooling nobody
You ain't fooling nobody but yourself
